# TeamSpeak Repo
* TeamSpeak's client and server repo,
* mirror of http://ftp.4players.de/pub/hosted/ts3/
# Why did I need a mirror?
* Sadly, I don't trust any of websites these days. All of the small companies falls down. 
* So i didn't want to lose these clients and servers. They're all memory for me.
* So that's why I created this repository. And everyone can use if "4players.de" falls too.
# Why is the release order of the versions different?
* The problem is not the by me. GitHub messes up the order. Even though I upload it to GitHub in order, the order is still different.
